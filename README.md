This app represents a Customer-Satisfaction survey.

It utilizes Flask to enable dynamic page generation based on survey content and record user responses - while only 4 questions are included, the app would accomodate changes to the total survey questions automatically. It will additionally redirect and warn users with any attempts to skip questions or access questions beyond the total.

The Question and Survey classes in the 'surveys.py' file were provided by Springboard.
